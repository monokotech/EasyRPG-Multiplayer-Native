Implementation of EasyRPG multiplayer in C++, through which you can quickly obtain the client and server.

This project incorporated multiplayer client code from another project in the form of patches. So, this is a project based on EasyRPG/Player, and the multiplayer client code has been imported from ynoproject/ynoclient. For details, see the first commit of this project 44347b6 (Initial commit. Add multiplayer changes).

You might ask what is the server based on. It reuses the client code, the server is like a mirror of the client (in terms of code). The C2S and S2C namespaces are removed, the two types of the packet are merged into one, making them bidirectional. As a result, the readability of messages.h has improved a lot. In the future, we might try to use binary data structures to refactor the packet classes again, to resolve the issue of not being able to include specific delimiters in the data.

If you are interested in this project, you can clone the repository to your local system to browse the code. If you don't know how to use Git, please refer to: [Git Manual](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Remember to switch to the master\_tmp branch, as many updates will be submitted there first.


## How to use

### Before the start

If you need to use the program but cannot compile it, you can go to the [Releases](https://github.com/monokotech/EasyRPG-Multiplayer-Native/releases) to download precompiled binaries. You need to choose the architecture that is suitable for the system you are currently using.

Open the terminal, which is cmd.exe for windows and Terminal.app for macOS.

And then use the file manager to drag the game folder to the terminal ([What is a game folder? See the FAQ below](#what-is-the-game-folder)).

Add `cd ` before the folder path. In cmd.exe, use `cd /d ` (/d means switching drive) to enter the game folder.

At this time you need to find the location of Player,
 then run the `<absolute path>/Player.exe` or the `<absolute path>/EasyRPG Player.app/Contents/MacOS/EasyRPG\ Player` for macOS.

The first run will display in full screen (this is the default behavior of EasyRPG Player).

If you don't like it, you can press F1 and select Video -> Fullscreen as OFF.

Finally go back and press `<Save Settings>` once, and return to the game menu.

Now, you can press F10 to bring up the Chat Ui, and F9 to toggle notifications (this is a layer within Player).

### Client Commands

`!help`

Show usage.

`!server [on, off]` (alias !srv)

You can run the server with this command.

As long as Player.exe can be run, the server can be started.

Servers can be started within a LAN (e.g. same WiFi or VPN), whether on mobile or computer.

`!connect [address]` (alias !c)

You can connect to the server with this command.

Enter the LAN IP, public IP, or domain name to connect to the server.

The status remains as "Connected", then it can be considered available.

`!disconnect` (alias !d)

Disconnect.

`!name [text]`

If you set !name \<unknown\> it will revert to the empty name.

`!chat [LOCAL, GLOBAL, CRYPT]` [CRYPT Password]

Switch chat visibility.

Enter !chat CRYPT [password] and a key will be generated.

After that, only clients with the same password can see the chat messages.

If the current visibility is CRYPT, it can be changed to other visibility, such as GLOBAL.

Enter !chat CRYPT again, no password is required and you can switch back to CRYPT.

What is CRYPT (encrypted chat)? [See the FAQ below](#what-is-chat-crypt).

`!log [LOCAL, GLOBAL, CRYPT]`

Enter a visibility to !log to hide or show messages in that visibility.

`!immersive` (alias !imm)

Toggle the immersive mode.

You can save the settings for the above commands via F1 -> \<Save Settings\>

The settings of the !connect, !name, !chat, and !immersive commands will be saved.

### Use Podman or Docker to run the server

Although this project uses podman, you can still use docker to do the same thing.

```
# Change directory
cd EasyRPG-Multiplayer-Native

# Build the image
podman build --build-arg TAG="$(git describe --tags)" -t epmp_img .

# Create the container
podman create --name epmp_container -p 6500:6500 epmp_img

# Start the container
podman restart epmp_container

# Remove the container
podman stop epmp_container && podman rm epmp_container
```

### Use the command line to run the server

Player.exe --server --bind-address 0.0.0.0[:port] --config-path /path/to/folder

Player.exe needs to be renamed with the corresponding executable filename based on your system.

Dedicated server example:

easyrpg-player-server --bind-address 0.0.0.0[:port] --config-path /path/to/file.ini

### Compile on linux

Arch Linux
```
# Install compilation tools
pacman -S gcc-libs cmake ccache

# Compile
# You can decide whether to compile a dedicated server by adjusting `-DBUILD_CLIENT=on -DBUILD_SERVER=off`
cmake -B build -DBUILD_CLIENT=on -DBUILD_SERVER=off -DPLAYER_MULTIPLAYER=on -DPLAYER_BUILD_LIBLCF=on -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache

## FAQ

### What is the game folder?

The game folder should include a lot of .lmu files, and may include the RPG\_RT.exe

### What is !chat CRYPT

The CRYPT using end-to-end encryption prevents chat messages from being captured by middlemen, such as servers, VPN servers or ISPs.

Encryption uses AES-256-GCM Authenticated Encryption.

The password will first be iterated 600000 times through PBKDF2 to obtain a 256bit key.

Then use the key to make an integer through CRC32 and passed to the server to match clients with the same password.

This key is saved to the configuration file as Base64.


The implementation is here: [chatui.cpp](https://github.com/monokotech/EasyRPG-Multiplayer-Native/blob/9b63310aa53409b5ac1c549c1a4601e5468c05f2/src/multiplayer/chatui.cpp#L881)

### How to make translation work?

Download the master.zip of ynotranslations and extract it:

https://github.com/ynoproject/ynotranslations/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

Find the folder as you need in the `ynotranslations`, then copy it to the game folder.
 Rename this copied folder as `Language` and restart the Player. After that, a new entry will appear in the game menu,
 enter and select language.

If you want to lock the language, you can pass --language \<name\> to the Player, the name
 you want is in the Language folder.

### How to limit the frame rate?

To enable frame limiter requires to turn off V-Sync.

For older laptops, it is recommended to limit the frame rate below 20fps
 to minimize fan noise.

Press F1 -> Turn V-Sync Off -> Change Frame Limter to 20

### Why doesn't Save Settings work?

The Save Settings will not have any feedback when it is saved, but it outputs
 a log in the terminal with the path of config.ini. In fact, the settings are saved.

Also, the multiplayer settings are included in the config.ini, i.e. you can use
 client commands without the arguments.

### Is there a key to mute or unmute?

Yes, you can press the M key to toggle mute on and off.
